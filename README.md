# Metagenomics_Project
For my Metagenomics course, I assessed the robustness of a research paper analyzing the gut microbiome of Sichuan Takin concerning seasonal changes in vegetation. I, also, came to my own conclusions about their relationship. 
The research article I focused on is titled Seasonal shift in gut microbiome diversity in wild Sichuan takin (Budorcas tibetanus) and environmental adaptation.
